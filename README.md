For this project when I started it I wasn't sure how to create the different layouts that I knew I would need to position everything correctly. Unfortunately, not until the day before it was due did I realize that I would probably need to use either the flex display or the grid display. After trying to use them for a bit I decided on using the grid display as it seemed to better suit my needs. This ended up in getting me a somewhat suitably acceptable website. I would have spent more time working on trying to incorporate the entire thing into a grid and using the wrapper to fully encapsulate everything. All of the little details of the project such as the specific colors of the words the italic or bolded words and some of the other details such as the links changing colors when hovered were all implemented correctly.
